The serial position effect is a term coined by Herman Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist, and pioneer of memory research. It describes how the position of an item within a sequence has an effect on the user’s recall accuracy. There are two main concepts involved in this theory;

1. **The Primacy Effect**: Items that are presented at the beginning of a list are recalled with greater accuracy than items in the middle of a list.
2. **The Recency Effec**t: Items that appear at the end of a list are also more likely to elicit better recall than items presented in the middle of a list.

It is unwise to present long lists of information as it places significant strain on the user’s memory system, especially short-term memory, where only 3 to 5 items can be maintained at one time. Our ability to recall previously items is also severely impacted by events between initial processing and later recall.

As designers, we can use the effect of primacy and recency in our designs to improve the overall user experience. By understanding how to manipulate the order of information, you can reduce the strain on your user’s memory load. Below are some ways you can utilize the serial positioning effect in your user interface design;

## Always display task-relevant information

In order to minimize the strain on your user’s memory load, it’s essential to maintain task-relevant information within the user interface. The information shown should be relevant to the current task in the user interface to minimize the load you put on your user’s cognitive capacity. This will allow them to be more efficient in their tasks, by removing the need to recall where each tool is located at.

Most desktop apps such as Sketch, Photoshop, Microsoft Word, Keynote, and many more, all place their toolbar at the top in order to help the user work more efficiently and effectively.

Sketch App places the toolbar at the top in order to help the user complete their task effectively.

## Manipulate the information order

According to the serial positioning effect, you can present important items at the beginning or at the end of a list to maximize recall. This depends on the amount of time required for the user to make a decision. If the decision is to be made at a later time, you can present your preferred item at the beginning of the list — in order to help the user remember it.

On the contrary, if the user has to make a decision immediately, then it would be better to place the most important item last as people tend to favor the last candidate presented to us.

An example would be Incensefalls where they placed the item name, price, and call-to-action button right at the top in order to increase the probability of users remembering it. The middle portion includes chunks of relatively less important information about the product while the last section highlights the important features and persuasive benefit of free shipping.

The same goes for Airbnb where they placed the most important information on the top and bottom of the listing page; the summary of listing, call-to-action, and availability of the place. They even hide most of the information in the middle section to prevent cognitive overload, allowing the user to focus on the information that matters most.

And below the availability is the review section which helps to end the user journey on a strong note — especially if there’re a lot of positive reviews. Since users usually take time to mull things over before making a purchasing decision, the last items will stand out more than the beginning or middle ones.

> Good reviews = Positive lasting impressions

## Lead with your deal clincher

Promotions and deals are necessary and common for most e-commerce sites. They are essential marketing tactics that help to increase conversion so it’s important to place them at the very top of the leading page. This will allow the user to better remember that there’s such a promotion — even after leaving the site.

ASOS always lead with their current sales promotion which captures the user’s attention.
