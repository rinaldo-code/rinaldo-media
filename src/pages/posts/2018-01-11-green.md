User research is used to understand the user’s behaviors, experience, needs, and motivations through various qualitative and quantitative methods. It’s research that prevents us from designing for one user; ourselves. It’s used to inform your team on the what, why, and how of the problem at hand so that they will be able to work with the end-user in mind.

> “User research outputs are only as good as the outcomes they drive.”

Yet, when presenting complex and data-driven information to team members, a 10-page report isn’t going to elicit the right reaction as it could get pretty dry; after all, presentation matters. The right presentation medium should be engaging and help develop empathy for the user.

And one of the best ways to present strategic, complex, and data-driven information in an engaging manner, is to use storytelling.

# The power of stories

Stories are a fun way of sharing and understanding complex data. If your product team comprises multiple people with diverse skillsets; all working towards the same goal, storytelling is a powerful tool to convey the user’s problem and unite everyone around a shared product vision. By transforming your data into a story, it makes it more relatable and comprehensible compared to just facts and graphs.

This powerful communication tool helps your team members retain information better; like how humans have been using stories to pass down important information. It also allows your team to more keenly empathize with the user when learning about their problem through a story — like how you’re able to relate to a character in a tv show.

As your company scales, it’s easy to lose sight of how your product should fit into the lives of your customers; this is normally taken for granted for mature products with a solid user base. The best way to keep everyone focused on the user is with a clear, compelling story; a story that will unite your team with a user-centric mentality.

# Crafting your story

The foundation of your story is the data collected through your user research; it will expose all the important moments of frustration, aspirations, and triumph which are potential plot points in your story.

## Step 1: The moral of the story

Before you start crafting your story, it’s important to understand what your key takeaway is; what insights should be communicated to your team members? This will form the key foundation of your story which should be supported by the overall narrative.

The key insight should be based on your research results;

* The most critical findings that have a major impact on the user’s experience
* The insights with the highest frequency — the majority of your users are facing the same problem

Once you have decided on your key takeaway, you can use the rest of your findings to form the narrative of your story in a way that supports it.

## Step 2: Planning the narrative

Unlike design scopes and prototypes, stories aren’t concerned with the aesthetics of a product; just the people who are using it and in what context. It could be based on a generic scenario, answering a simple question;*how will your product fit into the user’s daily lives?*

Donna Lichaw pointed out that most stories tend to follow a common framework; exposition, inciting incident, rising action, crisis, climax, denouement, and end.

The common framework stories follow as explained by Donna Lichaw in her book;[The User’s Journey](https://www.amazon.com/Users-Journey-Storymapping-Products-People/dp/1933820314).

Based on this framework, you can easily create a narrative where the user interacts with your product or service over time and across different settings and channels — how your product creates value in their daily lives.

An example of how you could use the framework to build a story.

## Step 3: Building the storyboard

Visualizing data, while intimidating to a lot of people who might not be good at drawing, is actually the most fun part of the process; once you’re used to it. Storyboards are a good way of visualizing the narrative that you previously planned out through a series of illustrated panels with short descriptions depicting each key point.

It’s important to make each storyboard as realistic as possible. The process of imagining each scenario forces you to consider the user’s thought process and emotions throughout the entire journey — building empathy with your users.

It isn’t necessary to have high-quality illustrations to depict the story. Stick figures would suffice. The visual you choose is less important than the actual story you tell.

While it might be less time-consuming to compile a report, telling a story forces you to step out of the designer’s mindset and consider how your product will fit into the lives of others. A story is also able to leave a lasting impact long after the presentation is over; do you even remember half of the information in a report?
