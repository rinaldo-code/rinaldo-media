Error prevention is one of the 10 usability heuristics by Jakob Nielsen.

Quoting Jakob Nielsen on error prevention:

> *“Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action”.*

# **What is error prevention?**

The ISO 25000 describes ‘error prevention’ as a **degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use**. In other words, designing in a way that it actually makes it harder for the user to commit errors.

The purpose of the ISO Standards (International Organization for Standardization) is to make services and products better so all kinds of companies and organizations can be more efficient. This organization develops and publishes international standards designed for specific industries, like the food industry, or designed to help improve the environment.

# **Ways to ensure error prevention**

This concept of error prevention is one of Jakob Nielsen heuristics. Besides being one of the major concepts to have good usability in a design, it also ensures more productivity since users are able to complete a task as fast and efficiently as possible without committing any error — making your product less error-prone.

Heuristics can be described as user experience (UX) best practices. In other words, the gold standard of UX.

## **Provide good defaults**

Helping your users by providing contextual accelerators can help enhance usability.

Take for example, how the Medium app on iOS suggests specific apps and people when you select the sharing option.

Or how the Mail app suggests a predicted folder when the user wants to organize the inbox. These suggestions can be ignored and the user still can select other options if they want to.

## **Give the user a fallback**

People make mistakes. It is nothing but human. Having an ‘Undo’ option not only provides confidence for the users while using your product but also has a huge impact on usability.

Gmail provides an ‘Undo’ option after sending an email

Gmail does this perfectly. Whether you’re sending an email or deleting one by mistake, Gmail gives you the opportunity to recover from a mistake.

## **Show instructions beforehand**

How many times do you type a password and submit the form only to find out that the passwords needs to be bigger, with alphanumeric characters and maybe an uppercase character as well.

## **Make important tasks bulletproof**

If you provide a product or service which has sensitive and/or important tasks you need to be taken seriously by helping users not make mistakes.

For instance, Mailchimp does not want users to delete or send an email by mistake. This email marketing service safeguards these tasks very well:

Great error prevention by asking users to type DELETE to confirm their actions

When a user wants to delete an email, it opens a second layer of confirmation to both prevent destructive actions and guide users to confirm that’s the action they really want to perform. In this case, unless the users type DELETE, they will not be able to delete an email.

Mailchimps’ sweaty monkey finger demonstrates error prevention when a user wants to send emails

And it follows the same strategy when users want to send out an email campaign. Before the email is released to the subscribers, it shows a pop-up that asks the user to confirm the action, making a user feel safe and creating an overall good user experience.

## **Provide suggestions**

One of the biggest misconceptions designers and teams make is that they think users know the product as much as them, otherwise, they’re just dumb users. That’s just not true and not inclusive nor accessible.

Of course, you can put all your cards on power users but they’re usually a smaller percentage of your users.

The king of contextual word suggestions, while the user is typing, is, of course, Google but you can also find this kind of suggestion in many e-commerce websites.

Take another example. Uber helps its users by giving contextual and very subtle helpers on specific inputs like where to find the 3–4 digit CVV number and the expiration date of their credit card.

A key takeaway is that people will always make mistakes. So if you want to make your product real user-friendly you need to consider:

* Offer suggestions as users can be distracted from the task at hand or simply new to the process
* Encourage double-checking and warn users before they perform sensitive and important actions
* Give users a fallback

Sure, a good product should inform its users about an error, but the best products are those which prevent users from making a mistake in the first place. You can say your product has a good user experience if you help users with error prevention.
