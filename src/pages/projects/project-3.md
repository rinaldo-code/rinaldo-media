EGFS is a growth financial and accounting services company. Largest in the venture capital space. The epicentre of this redesign concept is a focus on their most important services and valuable connections they've built with their existing client base.

This is just a first design iteration and we didn't end up implementing this concept for EGFS. What would follow is constant iteration of the design, prototyping, testing and implementing.

We would also work with their existing customers to uncover the most important features and increase the speed of the onboarding experience for future customers. This is a standard part of our process.
