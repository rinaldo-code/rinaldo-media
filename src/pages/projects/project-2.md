**THE PROBLEM**

Inity needed a new, evolved version of the main website that supports their business. They recognized a need for a website, but also understood that an out-of-the-box solution was apt to provide them with features they don't need whilst leaving gaps in terms of solution elements they require for their niche business.

**OUR SOLUTION**

Newly designed website encompasses the capabilities of a world-class tool that Inity is offering to its clients. Through this solution, visitors can understand not only what the the tool offers, but also their relationship with their potential new partner. But beyond appreciating the details of the present state of this website, Inity can easily add new information in the future.

**PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

Inity needed a new website, but suspected (correctly) that paying for a one-size-fits-all solution from a major platform provider such as Squarespace or Wix would require them to pay for an abundance of functionality that is not needed while leaving gaps in necessary areas. Moreover, Inity had a significant need for a website that was tailored to their needs and the niche market within which they operate.
